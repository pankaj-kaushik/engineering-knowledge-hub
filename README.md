# 📚 Software Engineering Hub 🚀

Welcome to the **Software Engineering Hub!** a continuously evolving **knowledge repository** documenting concepts, architectural patterns, engineering learnings, and practical notes gathered through hands-on experimentation and real-world system design experience.

This is a **centralized**, **open-source** digital garden dedicated to mastering the core pillars of modern software development. This repository serves as a live encyclopedia for engineers who never stop learning.


## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this hub is to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and production-grade implementation.

* **Interview Mastery:** Structured notes for System Design and Coding interviews.
* **Knowledge Persistence:** A "Second Brain" to store deep-dives into Microservices and Design Patterns.
* **Future-Proofing:** Staying ahead of the curve with Generative AI and LLM orchestration notes.
* **Documentation-as-Code:** Providing a clean, searchable interface via GitHub Pages.
